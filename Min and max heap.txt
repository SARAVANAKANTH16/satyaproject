                Min and max heap

Min heap: In the given almost complete binary tree or actual complete binary tree at 
every node is minimum or equal compared with its children ,then it is heap

Max heap: In the given cbt or acbt at every node root is maximum or equal compared with its
children than it is max heap

min ->root is smaller than child 
max->root is larger than child

Array representation of max heap tree
left child = 2i
right child =2i+1
parent - i/2

properties of complete binary tree
-----------------------------------
Height of Node= Max distance of that node to the leaf
Height of tree=Height of root node
Max number of nodes in CBT for height(h):

max node = 2^h+1-1

Min height for nodes(n) in cbt

min height=floor(logn)


 for nodes(n):
. 1 to floor(n/2) are non -leaf
. floor(n/2)+1 to n are leaves

in heapify it check the left child and right child with root if root is smaller then
swap is done
